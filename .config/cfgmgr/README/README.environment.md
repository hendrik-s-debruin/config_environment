General Linux Environment Dot Files
================================================================================

This repository tracks some basic Linux environment settings that I like to
carry around. This repository is currently very small, but may be broken up and
merged into other locations at some point.

I recommend cloning this repository using my configuration file manager,
[ConfigManager](https://github.com/hendrik-s-debruin/ConfigManager).
